ICE Task 1 
Lecturer : Dr Mushininga R.
Submission Date: Thursday 16 March 2023
Problem statement
Ms. Mulumba is the subject head of a big first-year programming subject at Thrivetech global technology institute. The subject has more than five hundred students with many lecturers involved in the teaching of small groups of fifty. As a subject head, Ms. Mulumba is responsible for the smooth running of the subject. After her students are done writing a test, she divides the students’ scripts evenly among the lecturers for marking. In case there are remaining scripts, she gives them to the last lecturer as additional marking.
Ms. Mulumba wants to automate this process of distributing work. Consequently, she comes up with a desktop application idea. The envisaged desktop application must allow her to determine the number of scripts each lecturer is going to mark and the estimated time it will take to finish marking. For the application to perform the above-mentioned tasks, the following inputs are needed:
•	The total number of scripts to be marked. This value must be greater than 0.
•	The number of questions constituting the test. This value must be between 1 and 10, both values inclusive.
•	The subtotal of each question. Each subtotal must be greater than 0.
•	The number of lecturers who are going to mark the scripts. The value must be more than 0.
After receiving the input data, the application must determine and display the number of scripts each lecturer is going to mark and the estimated time it will take each lecturer to finish marking their allocated scripts. Normally it takes two seconds for a lecturer to make a tick, which is a right or wrong tick. The estimated time to finish marking an allocated number of scripts must be calculated in hours and minutes. If after determining the minutes, we find that the remaining seconds are more than 30 but less than 60, the total minutes must be incremented by 1, otherwise, their impact must be ignored.
To do
Using C# create such an application for Ms. Mulumba
The application must be console based.
